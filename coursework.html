                      It considers problems drawn from a variety of domains
                      (including Computer Science) and emphasizes both the
                       broader applicability of the relevant data structures 
                       and programming concepts, as well as the implementation 
                       of those structures and concepts in software.
                        Topics include arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees,

                    build systems, debuggers, and performance tuning; 
                    all of the tools necessary for developing software as 
                    opposed to writing small programs.
                </p>

                <br><span>CSC 252:Computer Organization </span>
                <p>	- Basic machine organization; elementary hardware
                    concepts; CPU internals. Machine operations and 
                    instructions; assembly language concepts and 
                    programming.
                </p>

                <br><span>CSC 335:Object-Oriented Programming and Design </span>
                <p>	- Fundamentals of object-oriented software development.
                    Includes design principles, inheritance, polymorphism, 
                    Unified Modeling Language (UML), testing, event-driven 
                    programming with graphical user interfaces, applications 
                    of design patterns, and use of existing frameworks.
                </p>

                <br><span>CSC 337:Web Programming </span>
                <p>	- Introduction to the techniques and technologies 
                    for developing dynamic web sites. This course covers
                    both client-side and server-side development. Client-side
                    development will include HTML, CSS, Javascript, and AJAX.
                    Server-side development will include web server development,
                    deployment and integration with a DMBS. Other topics covered 
                    include: security concerns for web applications, password salting
                    and hashing, and domains. This course includes a team project to 
                    deploy a web application.
                </p>

                <br><span>CSC 345:Analysis of Discrete Structures </span>
                <p>	- Introduction to and analysis of algorithms and 
                    characteristics of discrete structures. 
                    Course topics include algorithm analysis techniques,
                     recurrence relations, structural induction, hierarchical
                      structures, graphs, hashing, and sorting.
                </p>

                <br><span>CSC 346:Cloud Computing </span>
                <p>	- This course focuses on cloud programming, with
                    an emphasis on using the cloud to solve Big Data problems.
                     The course will not only look at how distributed systems, 
                     databases, networks, etc. are used to implement cloud computing
                      platforms and cloud applications, but also the impact of the 
                      infinite scalability and pay-as-you-go on the platforms and applications.
                </p>

                <br><span>CSC 380:Principles of Data Science </span>
                <p>	- The course introduces students to principles of 
                    data science that are necessary for computer 
                    scientists to make effective decisions in their
                    professional careers. A number of computer science 
                    sub-disciplines now rely on data collection and analysis.
                    For example, computer systems are now complicated enough 
                    that comparing the execution performance of two different 
                    programs becomes a statistical estimation problem rather 
                    than a deterministic computation. This course teaches students
                    the basic principles of how to properly collect and process data 
                    sources in order to derive appropriate conclusions from them. 
                    The course has three main components: data analysis, machine learning,
                     and a project where students apply the concepts discussed in class 
                     to a substantial open-ended problem.
